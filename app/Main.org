Main to me is where all of the IO functions live. This lets me keep a very clear seperating line between the public facing bit, and the internals.
#+begin_src haskell
  module Main where
#+end_src

We will need all of the source that we have written up to now, as well as ~System.Environment~ so that we can get the arguments passed to the program.
#+begin_src haskell
  import System.Environment
  import PreProcessor
  import Parser
#+end_src

Then, we just string together all of the main functions from each of the parts of the project, sprinkle in a few monads, and let it do its thing.
#+begin_src haskell
  main :: IO ()
  main = getArgs >>= readFile . head >>= putStrLn . PreProcessor.preProcess
#+end_src
