#+title: The Parser
#+author: Cam A.

We start of by declaring the module (as we always do).
#+begin_src haskell
  module Parser where
#+end_src

And then we import a few things. We have Parsec for -- believe it or not -- parsing! I know, I didn't expect it either. And alongside it we have just imported an infix operator that does something, so that we're not writing ~x Parsec.<?> y~, and can instead write ~x <?> y~, which we can all agree is a lot easier to read, and looks very pretty.
#+begin_src haskell
  import qualified Text.Parsec as Parsec
  import Text.Parsec ((<?>))
#+end_src

Now, we start on the parser itself, which I will do later...
