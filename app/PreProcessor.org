The Preprocessor is rather simple. For now, all that it does is remove comments.
#+begin_src haskell
  module PreProcessor where


  preProcess :: String -> String
  preProcess = removeComs
#+end_src

To remove comments, we generate a list where each element is taken directly from the original program, until a ~;~ is encountered, at which point it drops all characters up to the newline.
#+begin_src haskell
  removeComs :: String -> String
  removeComs []       = []
  removeComs (';':cs) = (removeComs . dropWhile (/='\n')) cs
  removeComs (c:cs)   = c : removeComs cs
#+end_src
