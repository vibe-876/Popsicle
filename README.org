* The Popsicle Programming Language
This is my attempt at writing a Lisp in Haskell, because I am bored.
It is also one of my many excuses to play with literate programming.
* Dependencies
** Non-Optional
- Cabal
- Parsec
** Optional
Nothing (yet).
* Usage
Compile if needed, and then call
#+begin_src shell
  $ popsicle path/to/file
#+end_src
And that's it.

The recommended file extention is .pop, but popsicle doesn't check it, so do whatever you want.
